Java is a widely-used, high-level programming language renowned for its portability, 
    security, and robustness. Developed by James Gosling and released by Sun Microsystems in 1995, Java's core philosophy 
    is "write once, run anywhere," meaning that code written in Java can run on any device or operating system that has a 
    Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This platform independence, combined with its object-oriented nature, makes Java a popular 
    choice for building large-scale enterprise applications, mobile apps (especially Android), web applications, and 
    embedded systems. Java's extensive libraries, strong community support, and emphasis on reliability have 
    contributed to its long-standing popularity and importance in the software development industry.
